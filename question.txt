Why sometimes OAuth should be revoked despite valid credentials?
OAth is revoked despite valid credentials because 
there are cases when it can be a threat to give OAuth permission a to a user. 
For example, if a user has visited IP addresses that can be blacklisted, or there can be other indications about the user's information that causes a sort of self defense mechananism where Oauth is only protecting itself.
